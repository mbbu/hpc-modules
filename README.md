## Bioinformatics Software Installation Notes

This repo contains installation information for the bioinformatics software at the [icipe cluster](hpc01.icipe.org). We are using a module system to manage the software in the HPC. 

The installation notes outline how each of the software it was installed, while the modules directly store the module configuration files as contained in 
[icipe research computing infrastructure ](http://hpc01.icipe.org/doku.php?id=wiki:list_of_software) .

## updates
There is a basic [nvchecker](https://github.com/lilydjwg/nvchecker) configuration that can help check for new versions of installed applications:

`$ nvchecker .nvchecker/source.ini`
