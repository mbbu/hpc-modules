## Installation Process for hmmer software

HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for sequence homologs, and for making sequence alignments.

## 1. Download `hmmer` tar file in `/tmp` directory;

```
cd /tmp/
wget http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/hmmer.tar.gz
```

## 2. Unpack the `hmmer` tar file;

```
tar xf hmmer.tar.gz
```

## 3. Moved to the `hmmer` directory in `/tmp` dir;

```
cd hmmer-3.3.2/

```

## 4. Tried enabling `devtoolset-7` software collection using `scl` and starting a new Bash shell with the software collection enabled;

```
(base) [root@hpc01 hmmer-3.3.2]# scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
Cannot create a temporary file: /var/tmp/sclW59yPx
```

### `scl` command was not working despite `/var/tmp` having the right file permissions;

```
ls -ld /var/tmp
drwxrwxrwt. 8 root root 4096 Apr  4 10:33 /var/tmp

```

### N.B Don't change the file permissions of `/var/tmp` dir from 1777 to 777.

### Used `source` command to enable `devtoolset-7`;

```
(base) [root@hpc01 hmmer-3.3.2]# source /opt/rh/devtoolset-7/enable
(base) [root@hpc01 hmmer-3.3.2]#
```

## 5. Compiled `hmmer` software in `/opt/apps` dir;

```
(base) [root@hpc01 hmmer-3.3.2]# ./configure --prefix /opt/apps/hmmer/3.3.2

   compiler:             gcc -O3   -pthread

   linker:               
   libraries:              
   DP implementation:    sse

Now do 'make'  to build HMMER, and optionally:
       'make check'  to run self tests,
       'make install'  to install programs and man pages,
       '(cd easel; make install)'  to install Easel tools.


```
